##Game title:  
Cookie Fall

##Backstory: 
The year is 2020. The world has fallen into chaos. You wake up in shattered world with only one goal: YOU MUST WIN AGAINST THE FALLING COOKIES!

##Goal: 
The player must avoid getting hit by a falling cookie during each of the first 3 levels for 2 minutes each level. For the last level, the player obtains a cup of milk and instead of having to avoid the cookies, he has to catch a prescribed number of cookies before time ends. If he can pass all 4 levels, the player wins the game. 

##Mechanics: 
The player is a human stuck in a world of falling cookies. The player can move left and right, as well as jump, in order to avoid the falling cookies. If the player gets hit by a cookie before two minutes are up, an immediate game over is triggered and the player has to restart the level. If 2 minutes pass and the player has not been hit, the next level is activated. When the final level is reached, a cup of milk appear over the head of the player, and due to the weight of the cup, the player loses their ability to jump. They now can only move side to side in order to catch the cookies in their cup of milk. A cookie can only enter the cup of milk from the top and once the cookies passes the level equal to the top rim of cup, the cookie is lost. Catch enough cookies before 2 minutes passes, and the player wins. Do not catch enough, and the player has to start over from level 1. 

##Level and mode differences: 
There will be 4 levels to my game and the first 3 levels will be differentiated by the difficulty in avoiding falling cookies. In each level, the parameters that will change are as follows: the number of falling cookies, the speed at which the cookies fall, and the intelligence of the falling cookies. The first two parameters are self-explanatory, but what I mean for the last parameter is how well the cookies can predict the player’s next move. If all the cookies simply fall on the current position of the player, than the game would be easy because one would simply have to evacuate their current position. By having cookies fall not only on the player’s position, but also in front of them, behind them, and at random positions, the game becomes many times more difficult. For the last level, instead of having to avoid the cookies, the player will have to catch them. And instead of trying to catch the player, the cookies will not be programmed differently to avoid the player. They will be more frequent and quicker than the cookies in the 3rd level.

##Cheats:
Press 'c' to activate the shield cheat, which allows cookies to pass through the sprite without activating the hit event.
Press 's' to skip a level.
